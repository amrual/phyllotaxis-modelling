# 🌻 Phyllotaxis Simulator

An interactive simulator of phyllotaxis — the natural pattern of leaf, seed, and petal arrangement in plants.

Run the simulation and watch the famous Fibonacci spirals emerge from simple rules — the same spirals you can see in sunflowers, pine cones, and cacti.

## What you can do

- Tweak parameters and see how they affect the pattern
- Choose different kernel types — mathematical functions that define how primordia interact
- Add noise for more "organic" patterns
- Export and import configurations
- Share results via URL

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
